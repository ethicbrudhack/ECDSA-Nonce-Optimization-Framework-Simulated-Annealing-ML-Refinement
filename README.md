# ECDSA-Nonce-Optimization-Framework-Simulated-Annealing-ML-Refinement
This script implements a **hybrid optimization engine** designed for advanced analysis of ECDSA signatures, focusing on recovering potential nonce values (`k`) that minimize the variation in recovered private key candidates (`d`).
